# Backend API README

Welcome to our Backend API documentation for our project. This API provides two main routes for your use. Here's a breakdown of the API structure and how to use it effectively:

## API Response Structure

All responses from the API follow this structure:

```json
{
    "status": true, // Status boolean indicating success or failure
    "data": {},     // Data on success, can be an object, an array, a string, null, or undefined
    "message": ""   // Message providing additional information for errors and success
}
```

## Route 1: /

This route is a simple "Hello, world!" message. It's a great way to check if the API is up and running.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
    "status": true,
    "data": "Hello, world!",
    "message": "Success"
}
```

## Route 2: /members

This route returns a JSON array of objects containing details of GitHub community members. The details provided include:

- `name`: Name
- `username`: GitHub username
- `profile_pic_url`: Profile picture URL
- `followers`: Number of followers
- `following`: Number of people they follow
- `repositories`: Number of repositories
- `bio`: Bio
- `github_link`: GitHub profile URL

**Example Response:**
```json
{
    "status": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "username": "johndoe123",
            "profile_url": "https://github.com/johndoe123/profile.jpg",
            "followers": "1000",
            "following": "500",
            "repositories": "50",
            "bio": "I'm a software engineer."
            // ... Other details
        },
        // ... More member objects
    ],
    "message": "Success"
}
```

## Route 3: /members/:username

This route returns a JSON object containing details of a specific GitHub community member. The details provided include:

- `name`: Name
- `username`: GitHub username
- `profile_pic_url`: Profile picture URL
- `followers`: Number of followers
- `following`: Number of people they follow
- `repositories`: Number of repositories
- `bio`: Bio
- `github_link`: GitHub profile URL

**Example Response:**

```http
    GET /members/PRATHAM1ST
```

```json
{
    "status": true,
    "data": {
        "name": "Pratham",
        "username": "PRATHAM1ST",
        "github_link": "https://github.com/PRATHAM1ST",
        "profile_pic_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52632050?v=4",

        // ... Other details
    },
    "message": "Member found"
}
```
